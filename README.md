# CNN_TensorFlow

In this project a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is implemented with Tensorflow.

## Overview

The file "main.py" contains the Python source code.
The folder "trainedModels" contains the plots of the perfomance metrics for each model.
The folder "assets" contains the images which are shown below.

## Examples

The Convolutional Neural Network is tested on multiple examples:
Traffic signs, colored shapes and black shapes.
Some example images and the perfomance metrics during training are shown below.
